In this assignment I generated a random password using javascript for the first time in an assignment.
I started by creating my html and using bootstrap. With bootstrap, I was able to add a slider for the length of the password.
I then used css to center the content and style.
With javascript in the mix, I added the values for the passwords and and made a for loop to make the generator random. I then was able to make the website copy the password and add length of passwords using the bootstrap slider.
With the help of the algorithim created, I was able to generate a strong random password that can help people with sensitive data be protected and secure.
